    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web : HTML</h2>
    <p>Posted by <strong>Debbie</strong> on Tuesday, 12/20/2022</p>
    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies HTML,CSS and JavaScript. These are three languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post let us focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is about and you too should learn it.</p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper  <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>The opening tag</li> 
       <li>The closing tag</li>
       <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Why should we learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun 😃</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
